# The Sometimes Hidden Gems Of RHEL7
## aka cool things in RHEL7 that you might not know
James Pryor Sr. Software Engineer

This presentation was given at the [Tues Apr 18, 2017 meeting of the Raleigh Red Hat Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Raleigh-Red-Hat-User-Group/events/237752832/). The genesis of this presentation came from discovering more and more useful and cool things that are part of, or were added to RHEL7 since RHEL 7.0 was released in June 2014.
So today, weâ€™ll look at some of the cool, neat, or otherwise overlooked things that part of your RHEL subscription.
